# Introduction

## Overview of Deep Lake's High-Performance Compute Engine built in C++

#### Compute Engine offers high-performance implementations of compute-heavy Deep Lake features, such as distributed dataloading, large queries, and indexing. **The engine is built in C++ and the user-interface is in Python.**
