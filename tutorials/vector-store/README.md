## How to use Deep Lake as a Vector Store for LLM applications

Deep Lake can be used as a Vector Store for storing embeddings and their metadata including text, jsons, images, audio, video, and more. Its serverless architecture can be self-hosted, and it is also available via fully managed service.&#x20;

Deep Lake's designated API for Vector Store applications is shown in these tutorials. Details on the l[ow-level Deep Lake API are available here.](../deep-learning/)&#x20;
