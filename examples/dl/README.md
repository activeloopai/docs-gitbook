## Deep Lake as a Data Lake For Deep Learning

Deep Lake can be used as a data management tool for Deep Learning applications, enabling teams to create and ship models faster. Deep Lake's primary capabilities are:&#x20;

* Store and organize unstructured data (images, audios, nifti, videos, text, metadata, and more) in a versioned data format optimized for Deep Learning performance.
* Rapidly query and visualize your data in order to create optimal training sets.
* Stream training data from your cloud to multiple GPUs, without any copying or bottlenecks.
